# Create Transition Matrix on Monthly Basis

This project provides code to create so called transition matrices.

Background:
In a nutshell, after the business has built any segmentation model, end users normally would like to know how customers move across segments. Therefore, the segments are built dynamically so that lables on a customer level can tracked over time.

Once it has been done, a researched can built empirical transition matrix which will show on average how many customers stayed withing their segment, how many moved up and down in their engagement.
